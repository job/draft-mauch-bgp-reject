        <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
            <t>
                BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> speakers have many default
                settings which need to be revisited as part of improving
                the routing ecosystem.  There is a need to provide guidance
                to BGP implementers for the default behaviors of a well
                functioning Internet ecosystem.  Routing leaks <xref
                target="RFC7908" /> are part of the problem, but software
                defects and operator misconfigurations are just a few of
                the attacks on Internet stability we aim to address.
            </t>

            <t>
                Many BGP speakers send and accept all routes from a peer by
                default. This practice dates back to the early days of the
                Internet, where operators were permissive in offering routing
                information to allow all networks to reach each other. As
                the Internet has become more densely interconnected, the
                risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses significant risks
                to Internet routing.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification intends to improve this situation
                by requiring the explicit configuration of a BGP import
                and export policy for any EBGP speaking session such as
                customers, peers, or confederation boundaries in a base
                router or VPN instances.  When this solution is implemented,
                BGP speakers do not accept or send routes without policies
                configured on EBGP sessions.
            </t>

                The following requirements for the IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast
                Address Family apply to the solution described in this
                document:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Software MUST consider any routes from an EBGP peer as invalid, if no import policy was configured.</t>
                    <t>Software MUST NOT advertise any routes to an EBGP peer, if no export policy was configured.</t>
                    <t>Software SHOULD provide protection from internal failures preventing the advertisement and acceptance of routes.</t>
                    <t>Software MAY provide a configuration option to disable this security capability.</t>
                    <t>Software MUST operate in this mode by default.</t>
                </list>

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This document addresses the basic security behavior of how
                a BGP speaker propagates routes in a default configuration
                without policies. Operators have a need for implementers to
                address the problem through a behavior change to mitigate
                against possible attacks from a permissive security behavior.
                Attacks and inadvertent advertisements cause business
                impact that can be mitigated by a secure default behavior.
